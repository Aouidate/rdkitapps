I am an organic chemist by training, I have statred my journey in molecular modelling and CADD since 2014 during my PhD thesis that I defended in 2019.

I’m a computational chemist (6+ years) with a strong working background in Computer-Aided Drug Discovery approaches (QSAR, Molecular Docking, 
Molecular Dynamics), data analysis and Machine learning. I am actually an assitant professor and I also have two postdoc experiences, the first 
one at the Computer Aided Drug Discovery center, Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen, China, and 
the second one with the Structural Bioinformatics and Chemoinformatics team of **Pr. Pascal Bonnet**, at the Institute of Organic and Analytical 
Chemistry (ICOA), Orleans, France.
* Encoding ACE2/SARS-CoV-2 interactions as fingerprints using chemoinformatics tools like Rdkit and ODDT.
* Developement of chemoinformatics methods to dock and score protein-protein interaction inhibitors based on Tanimoto coefficient and SPLIF-score ( Structural Protein Ligand Interactions Fingerprints).
* Molecular dynamics simulation of protein-ligand complexes.
* Using « Fragment-Based Drug Discovery » to generate (LIMKs) protein kinases inhibitors.
