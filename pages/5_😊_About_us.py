Are you searching for a passionate and experienced computational chemist? 
Look no further! I am an organic chemist by training, but my journey in molecular 
modeling and Computer-Aided Drug Discovery began during my PhD thesis. With over 6 
years of experience in the field and a strong background in QSAR, Molecular Docking, 
Molecular Dynamics, data analysis, and Machine learning, I bring a unique set of skills to the table.

As an assistant professor, I have gained valuable experience, including two postdoc experiences, 
one with the Computer Aided Drug Discovery Center at Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology, 
Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen, China, and the other with the Structural Bioinformatics and 
Chemoinformatics team of Professor Pascal Bonnet, at the Institute of Organic and Analytical Chemistry (ICOA), Orleans, France.

With my expertise, I have honed my skills to become a leader in the field of computational chemistry. I am committed to guiding chemoinformatics and drug design
projects to achieve scientific goals by leveraging cutting-edge technologies and innovative approaches.

Join me on an exceptional journey into the world of molecular modeling and CADD, where I'm eager to support you in unlocking breakthrough scientific discoveries 
using the latest tools and techniques.
